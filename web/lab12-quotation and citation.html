    <p>Here is a quote from Peter Drury on Cristiano Ronaldo's return:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/T97nr6jlW54">
        He is here. <abbr title="Cristiano Ronaldo 7">CR7</abbr> is in the building... Madeira, Manchester, Madrid,
        Turin & Manchester again. Wreathed
        in red. Restored to this great gallery of the game. A walking work of art. Vintage, beyond valuation, beyond
        forgery or imitation.
